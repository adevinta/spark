# Keyboard Key

The keyboard key component exists to show which key or combination of keys performs a given action.

All shortcuts should do their best to match what appears on the user‚Äôs keyboard.

- All single letters A-Z are uppercase.
  - Do NOT use [Glyph unicode representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters) for the special key symbols.
- For non-letter keys such as enter, esc and shift, stick to lowercase.
- Use the arrow symbol as opposed to spelling things out.
- For function keys, stick to uppercase.
- For combination between keys and mouse events type the mouse event name upper-cased preceded by the üñ±Ô∏èunicode glyph.


<Canvas of={stories.Default} />

## Install

```sh
npm install @spark-ui/ui
```

## Anatomy

```tsx
import { Kbd } from '@spark-ui/ui/kbd'

export default () => <Kbd />;
```

## Examples

### Combinations

The only punctuation you should need is the + to indicate that a combination of keys will activate the shortcut.

<Canvas of={stories.ShiftPlusH} />

For a sequence of keys where one must follow the other, write "then" in between. Stick to lowercase to match the non-letter keys.

<Canvas of={stories.ShiftThenH} />

If two different keys can execute the same action or the shortcut itself may look different on the user‚Äôs keyboard, write "or" in between.

<Canvas of={stories.ShiftOrH} />

When combining a keyboard key and a mouse action combine it using the previous rules and the action name bold and uppercase preceded by the üñ±symbol glyph.

<Canvas of={stories.OptionPlusScroll} />
