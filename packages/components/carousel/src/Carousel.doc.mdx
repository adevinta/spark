# Carousel

A carousel is a user interface component that displays a collection of items, such as images or content cards, one (or a few) at a time within a single frame.

Users navigate through these items using controls like "Previous" and "Next" buttons or pagination indicators ("dots").

Carousels are ideal for presenting content sequentially, guiding users to focus on one item or group of items at a time.

## Install

```sh
npm install @spark-ui/carousel
```

## Import

```tsx
import { Carousel } from '@spark-ui/carousel'
```

## Props

<ArgTypes
  of={Carousel}
  description="Presents a set of slides, by sequentially displaying a subset of one or more items."
  subcomponents={{
    'Carousel.Viewport': {
      of: Carousel.Viewport,
      description:
        'Container for both the carousel items and the carousel controls. The carousel slide picker should remain outside of it.',
    },
    'Carousel.Items': {
      of: Carousel.Items,
      description: 'The scroll area of the carousel, contains all items to display in slides.',
    },
    'Carousel.Item': {
      of: Carousel.Item,
      description:
        'A single content container within a set of content containers that hold the content to be presented by the carousel.',
    },
    'Carousel.Controls': {
      of: Carousel.Controls,
      description:
        'Two interactive elements, styled as arrow buttons, that displays the next or previous slide in the rotation sequence.',
    },
    'Carousel.PagePicker': {
      of: Carousel.PagePicker,
      description:
        'A group of elements, styled as small dots, that enable the user to pick a specific page in the rotation sequence to display. Behave like a radiogroup',
    },
    'Carousel.PageIndicator': {
      of: Carousel.PageIndicator,
      description:
        'A button with "radio" role that takes you to a specific page in the carousel. You can customize it.',
    },
  }}
/>

## Usage

### Default

By default, the carousel will preserve the natural width of every item, and calculate its pagination from it.
The first cropped item on the right side will be the next snap point (start on the next slide).

It optimizes how many click are necessary to traverse the full list of items.

**a11y**: items outside of the carousel viewport will be considered inert/unreachable with keyboard navigation and screen readers.

<Canvas of={stories.Default} />

### Controlled

In this example you can control the carousel using picture thumbnails instead of dots.

<Canvas of={stories.Controlled} />

### Default page

To set the default page of the carousel, pass the `defaultPage` prop.

The page corresponds to the scroll snap position index based on the layout. It does not necessarily correspond to the index of the slide in the carousel.

<Canvas of={stories.DefaultPage} />

### Gap

To customize spacing between slides, set the `spacing` property. Value in pixels (integer).

<Canvas of={stories.Gap} />

### Loop

To allow looping of slides, set the `loop` property to `true`.

<Canvas of={stories.Loop} />

### Scroll behavior

Use `snap type`, `snapStop` and `scrollBehavior` props to control the scrolling behaviour.

**1. snapType**:

- `mandatory` (default): The visual viewport of this scroll container must snap to a snap position if it isn't currently scrolled.
- `proximity`: The visual viewport of this scroll container may snap to a snap position if it isn't currently scrolled. The user agent decides if it snaps or not based on scroll parameters. This is the default snap strictness if any snap axis is specified.
- `none`: When the visual viewport of this scroll container is scrolled, it must ignore snap points.

**2. snap stop**:

- `normal` (default): When the visual viewport of this element's scroll container is scrolled, it may "pass over" possible snap positions.
- `always`: The scroll container must not "pass over" a possible snap position; and must snap to the first of this elements' snap positions.

**3. scroll behaviour**:

- `smooth` (default): The scrolling box scrolls in a smooth fashion using a user-agent-defined easing function over a user-agent-defined period of time. User agents should follow platform conventions, if any.
- `instant`: The scrolling box scrolls instantly when interacting with the carousel controls.

<Canvas of={stories.ScrollBehavior} />

### Slides per page

To customize number of slides to show at a time, pass the `slidesPerPage` prop. The value must be an integer.

<Canvas of={stories.SlidesPerPage} />

### Slides per move

To customize number of slides to move at a time, set the `slidesPerMove` property in the machine's context. The value must be an integer or auto.

<Canvas of={stories.SlidesPerMove} />

## Advanced usage

### Custom page indicators

The `unstyled` prop of `Carousel.PageIndicator` allows you to use your own styles for the page indicators.
