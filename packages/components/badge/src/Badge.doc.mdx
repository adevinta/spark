# Badge

Badge component is a visual indicator for numeric values such as tallies and scores.

## Install

```sh
npm install @spark-ui/badge
```

## Import

```tsx
import { Badge } from '@spark-ui/badge'
```

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Badge} />

## Usage

### Default

When using `Badge` as a wrapper, it will position itself to the top-right corner of its child element.

<Canvas of={stories.Default} />

### Intents

Use `intent` prop to set the color intent of the badge.

<Canvas of={stories.Intents} />

### Standalone

When using `Badge` as a self-closing element, it is rendered inline, and is no longer positionned relatively to a specific element.

<Canvas of={stories.Standalone} />

### No count

<Canvas of={stories.NoCount} />

### Count threshold

Use `count` prop to display a number inside the `Badge`. There is a default threshold of `99` if you pass a larger number.

<Canvas of={stories.CountThreshold} />

### Sizes

Use `size` prop to set the size of the badge.

<Canvas of={stories.Sizes} />

## Accessibility

<A11yReport of="badge" />

It is recommended to use the `aria-label` attribute to improve the component's readability by assistive technologies. There is no automatic addition as this attribute should be explicit (human readable) and be independent from any internationalization constraint.

- Basic usecase: `[n] notifications`
- Large numbers usecase: `More than [n] notifications`
- Non-counting usecase: `New notification`
