# Button

Button component is used to trigger an action or event, such as submitting a form, opening a Dialog, canceling an action, or performing a delete operation.

## Install

```sh
npm install @spark-ui/button
```

## Import

```js
import { Button } from '@spark-ui/button'
```

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Button} />

## Default

## Disabled

Use `disable` prop to disable the element.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Disabled} />

## Sizes

Use `size` prop to set the size of a button.

## Intent

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Intent} />

## Icons

Compose the content of the button using the `Icon` component to add an icon to the left or right.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Icons} />

## Loading

Use the `isLoading` prop to render the button in loading state.
This will prepend a spinner inside the button.

It preserves the width of your button to avoid content layout shifting.

**a11y tip: use `loadingLabel` to set an accessible aria-label for when the button is in loading state.**

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Loading} />

### Loading with text

Alternatively, use `loadingText` if you prefer the loading text to be visible to the user (**Warning: using this might cause layout shifting**)

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.LoadingWithText} />

## Link

Use `asChild` so that the button takes the html tag and props of its direct child element.
In this example, if you need your button to be a link.

This polymorphic behaviour can be used with any type of HTML element.

<Callout kind="warning">
  If you do decide to change the underlying element type, it is your responsibility to ensure it
  remains accessible and functional. In the case of Tooltip.Trigger for example, it must be a
  focusable element that can respond to pointer and keyboard events. If you were to switch it to a
  div, it would no longer be accessible.
</Callout>

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Link} />
