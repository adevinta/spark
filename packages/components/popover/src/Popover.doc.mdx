/>

## Anatomy

A basic popover should have a trigger element and a content element.

The trigger is the element that should toggle the popover.
The content is the popover itself.

<Canvas of={stories.Default} sourceState="shown" />

## Controlled

You can use state to have better control over the behaviour of the Popover.
It allows you to open/close it from the outside.

Please note that is example is using `Popover.Anchor` to attach the Popover to a specific element.

<Canvas of={stories.Controlled} />

## Anchored

When you need to attach the popover to a different element than its `Popover.Trigger`, you must use `Popover.Anchor`.

If not used, then `Popover.Trigger` will be both the trigger element and the anchor for the popover.

When using `Popover.Anchor`, you can have multiple `Popover.Trigger` to trigger the same `Popover` in different ways

<Canvas of={stories.Anchored} />

## Match trigger width

Use this prop to make the Popover width match its trigger element width.

<Canvas of={stories.MatchTriggerWidth} />

## Boundaries

You can restrict the popover to stay inside a container (ref).
In this example, the Popover remains inside the grey container.

**Please note that it applies only to the width of the popover, to prevent the popover content from overflowing.**

<Canvas of={stories.Boundaries} />

## Positionning

By combining `side` and `align` you can achieve many positions for the popover.

- `side`: The preferred side of the anchor to render against when open. Will be reversed when collisions occur and avoidCollisions is enabled.
- `align`: The preferred alignment against the anchor. May change when collisions occur.

## Accessibility

Adheres to the [`Dialog WAI-ARIA design pattern`](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialogmodal).

### Keyboard Interactions

- `Space`: Open/Closes the popover.
- `Enter`: Open/Closes the popover.
- `Tab`: Moves focus to the next focusable element.
- `Shift + Tab`: Moves focus to the previous focusable element.
- `Esc`: Closes the popover and moves focus back to `Popover.Trigger`.
