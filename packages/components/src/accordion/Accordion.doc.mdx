# Accordion

An accordion is a vertically stacked set of interactive headings containing a title, content snippet, or thumbnail representing a section of content.

An `Accordion` is closed by default. Interacting with its trigger will open the associated content.

Important, as per ARIA specifications:

> **Each accordion header button is wrapped in an element with role [heading](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#heading) that has a value set for [aria-level](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-level) that is appropriate for the information architecture of the page.**

For this, you must wrap each `Accordion.ItemTrigger` with an `Accordion.ItemHeader` (`h3` by default, use `asChild` property of `ItemHeader` to set the heading level that matches your page structure).
For example, in the context of this storybook page, we use `h4` because the accordion is preceded by an `h3` already.

## Install

```sh
npm install @spark-ui/components
```

## Anatomy

```tsx
import { Accordion } from "@spark-ui/components/accordion"

export default () => (
  <Accordion>
    <Accordion.Item> 
      <Accordion.ItemHeader>
        <Accordion.ItemTrigger />
      </Accordion.ItemHeader>
      <Accordion.ItemContent />
    </Accordion.Item>
  </Accordion>
);
```



## Examples


### Controlled

Use `value` to control which panels are opened.

<Canvas of={stories.Controlled} />

### Design

Use `design` to pick the overall look of the component (`filled` or `outlined`).

<Canvas of={stories.Design} />

### Disabled

Use `disabled` to disabled the full `Accordion`.

<Canvas of={stories.Disabled} />

### Disabled item

Use `disabled` on `Accordion.Item` to disabled a single panel.

<Canvas of={stories.DisabledItem} />

### Multiple

Use `multiple` to allow multiple panels to be opened at the same time.

Use `defaultValue` to pass an array of panels values to open by default.

<Canvas of={stories.Multiple} />

## Accessibility

<A11yReport of="accordion" />

Adheres to the [Accordion Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/accordion/).

### Keyboard Interactions

- <Kbd>Enter</Kbd> - activates the disclosure control and toggles the visibility of the disclosure
  content.
- <Kbd>Space</Kbd> - activates the disclosure control and toggles the visibility of the disclosure
  content.

- <Kbd>Enter</Kbd> or <Kbd>Space</Kbd>: - When focus is on the accordion header for a collapsed
  panel, expands the associated panel. If the implementation allows only one panel to be expanded,
  and if another panel is expanded, collapses that panel. - When focus is on the accordion header
  for an expanded panel, collapses the panel if the implementation supports collapsing. Some
  implementations require one panel to be expanded at all times and allow only one panel to be
  expanded; so, they do not support a collapse function.
- <Kbd>Tab</Kbd>: Moves focus to the next focusable element; all focusable elements in the accordion
  are included in the page Tab sequence.
- <Kbd>Shift</Kbd> + <Kbd>Tab</Kbd>: Moves focus to the previous focusable element; all focusable
  elements in the accordion are included in the page Tab sequence.
- <Kbd>Down Arrow</Kbd> (Optional): If focus is on an accordion header, moves focus to the next
  accordion header. If focus is on the last accordion header, either does nothing or moves focus to
  the first accordion header.
- <Kbd>Up Arrow</Kbd> (Optional): If focus is on an accordion header, moves focus to the previous
  accordion header. If focus is on the first accordion header, either does nothing or moves focus to
  the last accordion header.
- <Kbd>Home</Kbd> (Optional): When focus is on an accordion header, moves focus to the first
  accordion header.
- <Kbd>End</Kbd> (Optional): When focus is on an accordion header, moves focus to the last accordion
  header.

### WAI-ARIA Roles, States, and Properties

- The element that shows and hides the content has role [button](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#button).
- When the content is visible, the element with role button has [aria-expanded](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-expanded) set to `true`. When the content area is hidden, it is set to `false`.
- Optionally, the element with role button has a value specified for [aria-controls](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-controls) that refers to the element that contains all the content that is shown or hidden.

- The title of each accordion header is contained in an element with role [button](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#button).
- Each accordion header button is wrapped in an element with role [heading](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#heading) that has a value set for [aria-level](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-level) that is appropriate for the information architecture of the page.
  - If the native host language has an element with an implicit `heading` and `aria-level`, such as an HTML heading tag, a native host language element may be used.
  - The `button` element is the only element inside the `heading` element. That is, if there are other visually persistent elements, they are not included inside the `heading` element.
- If the accordion panel associated with an accordion header is visible, the header `button` element has [aria-expanded](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-expanded) set to `true`. If the panel is not visible, [aria-expanded](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-expanded) is set to `false`.
- The accordion header `button` element has [aria-controls](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-controls) set to the ID of the element containing the accordion panel content.
- If the accordion panel associated with an accordion header is visible, and if the accordion does not permit the panel to be collapsed, the header `button` element has [aria-disabled](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-disabled) set to `true`.
- Optionally, each element that serves as a container for panel content has role [region](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#region) and [aria-labelledby](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-labelledby) with a value that refers to the button that controls display of the panel.
  - Avoid using the `region` role in circumstances that create landmark region proliferation, e.g., in an accordion that contains more than approximately 6 panels that can be expanded at the same time.
  - Role `region` is especially helpful to the perception of structure by screen reader users when panels contain heading elements or a nested accordion.
