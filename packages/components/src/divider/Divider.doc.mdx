# Divider

A separator between two elements, usually consisting of a horizontal line.

A few common uses are:

- Separating sections on a page
- Separating items in a list
- Creating a visual contrast between 2 sides of a page

<Canvas of={stories.Default} />

## Install

```sh
npm install @spark-ui/components
```

## Anatomy

```tsx
import { Divider } from '@spark-ui/components/divider'

export default () => (
  <Divider>
    <Divider.Content />
  </Divider>
);
```

## Examples

### Content

Spark-ui gives you the opportunity
to place an item on top of the divider by using its `Divider.Content` component as a children.

<Canvas of={stories.Content} />

### asChild

The `Divider` component is a `separator` rolled `div` unless you include an `asChild` boolean flag, and pass the element you prefer it becomes as an immediate child.
It can also work combined with `Divider.Content` inside of it.

<Canvas of={stories.asChild} />

### Decorative

Using `isDecorative` boolean flag prop makes the Divider only visual in terms of accessibility, not adding any role to the html element.

<Canvas of={stories.Decorative} />

### Alignment

When adding a `Divider.Content` element as a children you can align it using the `alignment` prop in the `Divider` component.

<Canvas of={stories.Alignment} />

### Orientation

The divider can set its orientation setting it as a prop.

<Canvas of={stories.Orientation} />

### Intent

The divider can set its intent setting it as a prop.

<Canvas of={stories.Intent} />

## Advanced Examples

### Wrapped Content

Users can also rotate the text to achieve the proper design.

<Canvas of={stories.WrappedContent} />

### Card Content

<Canvas of={stories.Card} />
