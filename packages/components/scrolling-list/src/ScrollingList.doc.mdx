# ScrollingList

A scrolling list presents a series of items arranged horizontally or vertically, allowing users to explore the content by scrolling.

Each item maintains its natural size, which can result in varying dimensions and the possibility of partial visibility.

This format is suitable when offering an overview of available content, enabling users to quickly browse through a collection without a predefined structure.

## Install

```sh
npm install @spark-ui/scrolling-list
```

## Import

```tsx
import { ScrollingList } from '@spark-ui/scrolling-list'
```

## Props

<ArgTypes
  of={ScrollingList}
  description="Presents a set of slides, by sequentially displaying a subset of one or more items."
  subcomponents={{
    'ScrollingList.Items': {
      of: ScrollingList.Items,
      description:
        'The scroll area of the scrolling list, contains all items to display in slides.',
    },
    'ScrollingList.Item': {
      of: ScrollingList.Item,
      description:
        'A single content container within a set of content containers that hold the content to be presented by the scrolling list.',
    },
    'ScrollingList.Controls': {
      of: ScrollingList.Controls,
      description:
        'Two interactive elements, styled as arrow buttons, that displays the next or previous slide in the rotation sequence.',
    },
    'ScrollingList.SkipButton': {
      of: ScrollingList.SkipButton,
      description:
        'A button only visible for keyboard users. Allow them to skip the content of the scrolling list entirely.',
    },
  }}
/>

## Usage

### Default

By default, the scrolling-list will preserve the natural width of every item, and calculate its pagination from it.
The first cropped item on the right side will be the next snap point (start on the next slide).

It optimizes how many click are necessary to traverse the full list of items.

**a11y**: items outside of the scrolling-list viewport will be considered inert/unreachable with keyboard navigation and screen readers.

### Controlled



### Gap

To customize spacing between items, set the `gap` property. Value in pixels (integer).

<Canvas of={stories.Gap} />

### Loop

To allow looping of slides, set the `loop` property to `true`.

<Canvas of={stories.Loop} />

### Scroll behavior

Use `snap type`, `snapStop` and `scrollBehavior` props to control the scrolling behaviour.

**1. snapType**:

- `mandatory` (default): The visual viewport of this scroll container must snap to a snap position if it isn't currently scrolled.
- `proximity`: The visual viewport of this scroll container may snap to a snap position if it isn't currently scrolled. The user agent decides if it snaps or not based on scroll parameters. This is the default snap strictness if any snap axis is specified.
- `none`: When the visual viewport of this scroll container is scrolled, it must ignore snap points.

**2. snap stop**:

- `normal` (default): When the visual viewport of this element's scroll container is scrolled, it may "pass over" possible snap positions.
- `always`: The scroll container must not "pass over" a possible snap position; and must snap to the first of this elements' snap positions.

**3. scroll behaviour**:

- `smooth` (default): The scrolling box scrolls in a smooth fashion using a user-agent-defined easing function over a user-agent-defined period of time. User agents should follow platform conventions, if any.
- `instant`: The scrolling box scrolls instantly when interacting with the scrolling-list controls.

### Scroll padding

Use `scrollPadding` to always display the right-most part of the previous page to the user, highlighting that there is more content to the left.

**Note: will be ignored if `snapType` is set to `none`.**
