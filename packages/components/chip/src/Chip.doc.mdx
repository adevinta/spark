## Variants

<Canvas of={stories.Default} />

## Assist

Assist chips represent smart or automated actions that can span multiple apps,
such as opening a calendar event from the home screen.
Assist chips function as though the user asked an assistant to complete the action.
They should appear dynamically and contextually in a UI.

An alternative to assist chips is buttons, which should appear persistently and consistently.

## Filter

Filter chips represent filters for a collection.
They use tags or descriptive words to filter content.
They can be a good alternative to toggle buttons or checkboxes.

Tapping on a filter chip activates it and appends a leading checkmark icon to the starting edge of the chip label.

### Single selection

<Canvas of={stories.SingleSelectionFilter} />
When there is no element selected (no filter applied) all the results are shown.

### Multiple Selection

Multi Selection Filters can represent unions or intersections between multiple categories.

#### Union

The results shown on a union filter are all the elements that satisfy at least 1 of the selected filters.

<Canvas of={stories.UnionFilter} />

- When there is no element selected (no filter applied) all the results are shown.
- When all the elements are selected all the results are shown.

#### Intersection

The results shown on a union filter are all the elements that satisfy all the selected filters.

<Canvas of={stories.IntersectionFilter} />

- When there is no element selected (no filter applied), all the results are shown.
- When all the elements are selected only shows the results that
satisfy all the filters (normally none of them).

## Input

Input chips represent discrete pieces of information entered by a user, such as Gmail contacts or filter options within a search field.

They enable user input and verify that input by converting text into chips.
