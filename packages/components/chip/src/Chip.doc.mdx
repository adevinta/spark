# Chip

Help people enter information, make selections, filter content, or trigger actions.

#### Chips aren’t buttons

<Callout kind="warning">
  Chips and buttons are similar in that they both provide visual cues to prompt users to take
  actions and make selections. However, there are important distinctions to be aware of.
</Callout>
<br />
<Callout kind="warning">
  Multiple chips should appear together in a group, whereas there should be no more than 3 buttons
  in a single arrangement.
</Callout>

Chips are reactive and contextual, whereas buttons are static and predetermined.
A chip should offer a different action depending on the nature of the content it supports,
whereas a button should be a persistent fixture of a layout.
From a user-flow perspective,
Chips represent forking paths in an experience while a button represents a linear step along a flow.

Chips handle 4 different features:

- **Display** data
- Fire **Actions** (button role)
- Handle **Selections** (button role selected)
- Manage **Deletions** (clear button)

Combining those features chips give 4 different usages:

- [Assist](#assist)
- [Filter](#filter)
- [Input](#input)
- [Suggestion](#suggestion)

## Advanced usage

### Assist

Assist chips represent smart or automated actions that can span multiple apps,
such as opening a calendar event from the home screen.

Assist chips function as though the user asked an assistant to complete the action.
They should appear dynamically and contextually in a UI.

An alternative to assist chips is buttons, which should appear persistently and consistently.

<Canvas of={stories.AssistEvent} />

### Filter

Filter chips represent filters for a collection.
They use tags or descriptive words to filter content.
They can be a good alternative to toggle buttons or checkboxes.

Tapping on a filter chip activates it and appends a leading checkmark icon to the starting edge of the chip label.

#### Single selection

<Canvas of={stories.SingleSelectionFilter} />

When there is no element selected (no filter applied) all the results are shown.

#### Multiple Selection

Multi Selection Filters can represent unions or intersections between multiple categories.

##### Union

The results shown on a union filter are all the elements that satisfy at least 1 of the selected filters.

<Canvas of={stories.UnionFilter} />

- When there is no element selected (no filter applied) all the results are shown.
- When all the elements are selected all the results are shown.

##### Intersection

The results shown on a union filter are all the elements that satisfy all the selected filters.

<Canvas of={stories.IntersectionFilter} />

- When there is no element selected (no filter applied), all the results are shown.
- When all the elements are selected only shows the results that
  satisfy all the filters (normally none of them).

### Input

Input chips represent discrete pieces of information entered by a user, such as Gmail contacts or filter options within a search field.

They enable user input and verify that input by converting text into chips.

<Canvas of={stories.Input} />

### Suggestion

Suggestion chips help narrow a user’s intent by presenting dynamically generated suggestions, such as possible responses or search filters.

<Canvas of={stories.Suggestion} />

Suggestion chips can offer quick-reply options in a chat or email app, or It can help the user start a search.
