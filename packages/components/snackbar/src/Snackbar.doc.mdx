## Usage

### Default

To get started, render a `<Snackbar />` provider **at the root of your app**. It will manage the snackbar queue and state for the whole app. Then, to display a snackbar message from any part of the app, you would simply call the `addSnackbar` function.

Customizing each snackbar is made easy using the `addSnackbar` function options. Additionally, you can define global attributes for all snackbars by using the compound API with `<Snackbar.Item />` as children of the `<Snackbar />` component (refer to detailed examples below).

Please note that `addSnackbar` options will always take precedence over `<Snackbar.Item />` (and its subcomponents) props. Conversely, any element defined using the compound component, such as close or action buttons, will consistently appear on the `Snackbar` item. Additionally, their optional props will override `addSnackbar` options in this specific scenario.

<Canvas of={stories.Default} />

### Design

To set different look and feels, use `design` option from `addSnackbar`, or `<Snackbar.Item />` associated prop.

<Canvas of={stories.Design} />

### Intent

To set different look and feels, use `intent` option from `addSnackbar`, or `<Snackbar.Item />` associated prop.

<Canvas of={stories.Intent} />

### Icon

To add an icon before message use `icon` option from `addSnackbar`, or use `<Snackbar.ItemIcon />` within your custom `<Snackbar.Item />`.

<Canvas of={stories.Icon} />

### Close

**To dismiss snackbar automatically** use `timeout` option. For accessibility reasons the value of this timeout shouldn't be less than 5 seconds. Also for the same reasons **timers will automatically pause when the user focuses or hovers over a snackbar**.

**To allow the user to close the snackbar** thanks to a dedicated close button, use `isClosable` option from `addSnackbar`, or use `<Snackbar.ItemClose />` within your custom `<Snackbar.Item />`.

For both cases there is a specific `onClose` handler which is called when snackbar closes.

<Canvas of={stories.Close} />

### Action

To add an action to the snackbar use `onAction` and `actionLabel` options from `addSnackbar`, or use `<Snackbar.ItemAction />` within your custom `<Snackbar.Item />`. After interacting with it the snackbar will close automatically.

Keep in mind that users might miss snackbar actions and thus these shouldn't concern important things. In such case please use instead the `AlertDialog` component.

For accessibility reasons **snackbars won't dismiss automatically when an action is provided**.

<Canvas of={stories.Action} />

## Advanced usage

### Force action/close button

To always render snackbars with their associated action and/or close buttons, you simply need to declare them within a custom `<Snackbar.Item>` implementation.

<Canvas of={stories.AdvancedActionClose} />

## Accessibility

Adheres to the [Alert WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alert).

### Keyboard Interactions

- <Kbd>F6</Kbd>: Focuses snackbar region viewport.
- <Kbd>Tab</Kbd>: Moves focus to the next focusable element.
- <Kbd>Shift+Tab</Kbd>: Moves focus to the previous focusable element.
- <Kbd>Enter</Kbd>: When focus is on a `Snackbar.ItemAction` or `Snackbar.ItemClose`, closes the
  toast.
- <Kbd>Space</Kbd>: When focus is on a `Snackbar.ItemAction` or `Snackbar.ItemClose`, closes the
  toast.
