# Portal

Renders a React subtree in a different part of the DOM.

- Render any React subtree outside of your App.
- Appends to `document.body` by default but can be customized to use a different container.

## Install

```
npm install @spark-ui/portal
```

## Import

```
import { Portal } from "@spark-ui/portal"
```

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Portal} />

## Usage

In the following example, the JSX element is located in the left block, but rendered inside the right block.

This is because we wrapped it with a `Portal` whose `container` is the block to the right.

<Canvas of={PortalStories.Usage} />
