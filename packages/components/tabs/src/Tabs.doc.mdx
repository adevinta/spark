# Tabs

A set of layered sections of content—known as tab panels—that are displayed one at a time.

## Install

```
npm install @spark-ui/tabs
```

## Import

```
import { Tabs } from "@spark-ui/tabs"
```

## Props

<ArgTypes
  of={Tabs}
  description="Contains all the tabs component parts."
  subcomponents={{
    'Tabs.List': {
      of: Tabs.List,
      description: 'Contains the triggers that are aligned along the edge of the active content.',
    },
    'Tabs.Trigger': {
      of: Tabs.Trigger,
      description: 'The button that activates its associated content.',
    },
    'Tabs.Content': {
      of: Tabs.Content,
      description: 'Contains the content associated with each trigger.',
    },
  }}
/>

## Usage

### Default

<Canvas of={stories.Default} />

### Disabled

Use `disabled` prop on item to set related state to it. Other states (`:hover|:focus|...`) are automatically managed.

<Canvas of={stories.State} />

### Icons

You can use `Icons` inside your `Tabs.Trigger` elements.

<Canvas of={stories.Icons} />

### Intent

Use `intent` prop to set the color of active tab item.

<Canvas of={stories.Intent} />

### Orientation

Use `orientation` prop to set `horizontal|vertical` orientation.

<Canvas of={stories.Orientation} />

### Overflow

For `horizontal` orientation only, navigation arrows are automatically displayed to help user browse tabs on content overflow. Use then `loop` prop on list to allow navigation loop from last tab to first, and vice versa.

<Canvas of={stories.Overflow} />

### Size

Use `size` prop to set the size of items.

<Canvas of={stories.Size} />

### forceMount

Use `forceMount` on `Tabs` when you want the content of your inactive tabs to remain in the DOM, instead of being removed.

This can be useful if your tabs load heavy resources on mount, such as heavy images, videos, iframes, etc...

<Canvas of={stories.ForceMount} />
