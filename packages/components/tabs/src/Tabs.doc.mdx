- `ArrowRight`: Moves focus to the next trigger depending on `orientation` and activates its associated content.
- `ArrowUp`: Moves focus to the previous trigger depending on `orientation` and activates its associated content.
- `ArrowLeft`: Moves focus to the previous trigger depending on `orientation` and activates its associated content.
- `Home`: Moves focus to the first trigger and activates its associated content.
- `End`: Moves focus to the last trigger and activates its associated content.
