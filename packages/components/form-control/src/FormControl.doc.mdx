# FormControl

Provide context to your form elements

- `FormControl` the wrapper that provides context and functionality for all children.
- `FormLabel` the label of a form section. The usage is similar to html label. `htmlFor` is set by default for children input.
- `FormHelperText` the message that tells users more details about the form section.
- `FormErrorMessage` the message that shows up when an error occurs.
- `FormControlState` provides input props using render props.

## Install

```sh
npm install @spark-ui/form-control
```

## Import

```tsx
import { FormControl } from '@spark-ui/form-control'
```

## Props

<ArgTypes of={FormControl} />

## Usage

By default, all Spark input components use `FormControlState` behind the scenes, so you do not need to use it explicitly. However, if you want to use a custom input component, or if you need more fine-grained control over the state of a form control, you can use it.

<Canvas of={stories.Default} />

## Invalid

`FormErrorMessage` will only show up when the property `isInvalid` in `FormControl` is `true`.

<Canvas of={stories.Invalid} />
