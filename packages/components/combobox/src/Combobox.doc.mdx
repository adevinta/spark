# Combobox

A combobox is an input widget that has an associated popup.

The popup enables users to choose one or multiple values for the input from a collection. The popup itself contains a listbox of items.

AutoComplete is used as the default behaviour. The user can only type a value that exists in the list of suggestions.

<Canvas of={stories.Default} />

#### ComboBox is not a Dropdown

<Callout kind="warning">
  Dropdowns and Comboboxes are similar in that every both provide visual selectable options for
  users. However, there are important distinctions to be aware of.
</Callout>

#### Dropdown, Select and Combobox

Dropdown, Select and Combobox are visually similar when its options are not displayed
(unfocused closed trigger element).
All of them also share the same behavior on its options/items, toggling its own item's
value to its parent selected state.

However, they have different behaviors and purposes:

- Dropdown:
  - **Closed** list of options for the user to pick triggered by a button.
  - The trigger element is rolled as a **button**.
  - The options are displayed fully customizable inside a **popover** (normally).
- Select:
  - **Closed** list of options for the user to pick triggered by a button.
  - The structural select role, an abstract role, is superclass role for four form widgets, `listbox`, `menu`,
    `radiogroup`, and `tree`, which allow users to make selections from a set of choices.
  - The options can only be text and are its look and feel is managed by the browser natively.
  - Cannot be used for multiple selections.
- Combobox
  - **Open** list of options for the user to pick triggered by a button.
  - The trigger element is rolled as an **input**.
  - The options can be text or any other JSX markup.
  - Can be used for multiple selections.
  - Can be used inside a form.

## Install

```sh
npm install @spark-ui/combobox
```

## Anatomy

```tsx
import { Combobox } from '@spark-ui/combobox'

export default () => (
  <Combobox>
    <Combobox.Trigger>
      <Combobox.LeadingIcon />
      <ComboBox.SelectedItems /> // only when multiple selection is used
      <Combobox.Input />
      <Combobox.TrailingIcon />
      <Combobox.ClearButton />
      <Combobox.Disclosure />
    </Combobox.Trigger>
    <ComboBox.Popover>
      <Combobox.Items>
        <Combobox.Empty />
        <Combobox.Group>
          <Combobox.Label />
          <Combobox.Item>
            <ComboBox.ItemIndicator />
            <ComboBox.ItemText />
          </Combobox.Item>
        </Combobox.Group>
      </Combobox.Items>
    </ComboBox.Popover>
  </Combobox>
);
```

## Examples

### Controlled

Use `value` and `onValueChange` props to control the selected item of the combobox.

Use `open` and `onOpenChange` props to control the opened state of the combobox menu.

<Canvas of={stories.Controlled} />

### Custom value entry

Combobox can be configured to allow typing custom values that arenâ€™t included in the list of options.

<Canvas of={stories.CustomValueEntry} />

### Disabled

Use `disabled` on the root component to disable the combobox entirely.

<Canvas of={stories.Disabled} />

### Disabled Item

Use `disabled` on individual `Combobox.Item` to disable them.

<Canvas of={stories.DisabledItem} />

### Filtering

By default, `filtering` is set to `auto` and will only filter items when the user is typing.

Set it to `none` to disabled item filtering (you can then implement your own filtering logic).

Set it to `strict` to filter items based on the input value, even when the user is not typing.

<Canvas of={stories.Filtering} />

### Groups

Similar to `optgroup` HTML tag, you can gather your items in groups.

It is important to use `Combobox.Label` inside each `Combobox.Group` to give it an accessible name.

<Canvas of={stories.Grouped} />

### Item indicator

Renders when the parent `ComboboxMenu.Item` is selected.

You can style this element directly, or you can use it as a wrapper to put an icon into, or both.

<Canvas of={stories.ItemIndicator} />

### Leading icon

Use `Combobox.LeadingIcon` inside `Combobox.Trigger` to prefix your trigger with an icon.

<Canvas of={stories.LeadingIcon} />

### Read only

Use `readOnly` prop to indicate the combobox is only readable.

<Canvas of={stories.ReadOnly} />

### isLoading

Use the `isLoading` prop to render the combobox in loading state.
This will prepend a spinner inside the items-list.

<Canvas of={stories.IsLoading} />

### Status

Use `state` prop to assign a specific state to the combobox, choosing from: `error`, `alert` and `success`. By doing so, the outline styles will be updated.

You could also wrap `Combobox` with a `FormField` and pass the prop to `Formfield` instead.

<Canvas of={stories.Statuses} />

## Multiple selection

### Default

When using `multiple` mode, the component manages an array of values and no longer a single value.

It means you must adapt `value`, `onValueChange` and `defaultValue` accordingly.

In `multiple` mode, the combobox won't close when the user selects an item, and it is possible to unselect every item.

In multiple selection mode, the input will go back to empty state after each selection in the list.
This is up to the developer to make it clear to the user which items are selected, by using other components such as chips, for example.

<Canvas of={stories.MultipleSelection} />

### Controlled

Use `value` and `onValueChange` props to control the selected items of the combobox.

Use `open` and `onOpenChange` props to control the opened state of the combobox menu.

<Canvas of={stories.MultipleSelectionControlled} />

### Disabled

Use `disabled` on the root component to disable the combobox entirely.

<Canvas of={stories.MultipleSelectionDisabled} />

### Read only

Use `readOnly` prop to indicate the combobox is only readable.

<Canvas of={stories.MultipleSelectionReadonly} />

### Single line

Set `wrap` property to `false` if you wish to keep the component on a single line.
This can be useful when the component is used inside a sticky navbar.

<Canvas of={stories.MultipleSelectionNoWrap} />

## Advanced Examples

### Custom item

If your `Combobox.Item` contains anything else than raw text, you may use any JSX markup to customize it.

**If you do so, you MUST use `Combobox.ItemText` inside of your item to give it a proper accessible name.**

<Canvas of={stories.CustomItem} />

### Search Modal

<Canvas of={stories.ModalSearch} />

## Form field

### Label

Use `FormField.Label` to add a label to the input.

<Canvas of={stories.FormFieldLabel} />

### Hidden label

In certain cases, a visible label may not be necessary. To achieve this behavior, use the `VisuallyHidden` component.

<Canvas of={stories.FormFieldHiddenLabel} />

### Required

Use the `isRequired` prop of the `FormField` to indicate that the combobox is required.

<Canvas of={stories.FormFieldRequired} />

### Disabled

The combobox `disabled` field status can be managed by the FormField `disabled` flag.

<Canvas of={stories.FormFieldDisabled} />

### ReadOnly

Apply `readOnly` to the wrapping `FormField` to indicate the combobox is only readable.

<Canvas of={stories.FormFieldReadOnly} />

### Validation

Set the `state` prop of the `FormField` to `error` to indicate that the combobox is invalid. Optionally use the `FormField.ErrorMessage` to describe why the combobox is invalid.

<Canvas of={stories.FormFieldValidation} />
