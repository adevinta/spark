# Dropdown

Dropdown is an interactive element
that allows users to select an option from a list of choices presented in a collapsible menu.
It saves space on the interface by concealing the options until the user interacts with the component.

Displays a **closed** list of options for the user to pick triggered by a button.

#### Dropdown is not a ComboBox

<Callout kind="warning">
  Dropdowns and Comboboxes are similar in that every both provide visual selectable options for
  users. However, there are important distinctions to be aware of.
</Callout>

#### Dropdown, Select and Combobox

Dropdown, Select and Combobox are visually similar when its options are not displayed
(unfocused closed trigger element).
All of them also share the same behavior on its options/items, toggling its own item's
value to its parent selected state.

However, they have different behaviors and purposes:

- Dropdown:
  - **Closed** list of options for the user to pick triggered by a button.
  - The trigger element is rolled as a **button**.
  - The options are displayed fully customizable inside a **popover** (normally).
- Select:
  - **Closed** list of options for the user to pick triggered by a button.
  - The structural select role, an abstract role, is superclass role for four form widgets, `listbox`, `menu`,
    `radiogroup`, and `tree`, which allow users to make selections from a set of choices.
  - The options can only be text and are its look and feel is managed by the browser natively.
  - Cannot be used for multiple selections.
- Combobox
  - **Open** list of options for the user to pick triggered by a button.
  - The trigger element is rolled as an **input**.
  - The options can be text or any other JSX markup.
  - Can be used for multiple selections.
  - Can be used inside a form.

## Usage

### Default

<Canvas of={stories.Default} />

### Controlled

Use `value` and `onValueChange` props to control the value of the dropdown.

<Canvas of={stories.Controlled} />

### Controlled open state

Use `open` and `onOpenChange` props to control when the dropdown is opened or closed.

<Canvas of={stories.ControlledOpenState} />

### Disabled

Use `disabled` on the root component to disable the dropdown entirely.

<Canvas of={stories.Disabled} />

### Disabled Item

Use `disabled` on individual `Dropdown.Item` to disable them.

<Canvas of={stories.DisabledItem} />

### Groups

Similar to `optgroup` HTML tag, you can gather your items in groups.

It is important to use `Dropdown.Label` inside each `Dropdown.Group` to give it an accessible name.

<Canvas of={stories.Grouped} />

### Item indicator

Renders when the parent `DropdownMenu.Item` is selected.

You can style this element directly, or you can use it as a wrapper to put an icon into, or both.

<Canvas of={stories.ItemIndicator} />

### Read only

Use `readOnly` prop to indicate the dropdown is only readable.

<Canvas of={stories.ReadOnly} />

### Status

Use `state` prop to assign a specific state to the dropdown, choosing from: `error`, `alert` and `success`. By doing so, the outline styles will be updated.

You could also wrap `Dropdown` with a `FormField` and pass the prop to `Formfield` instead.

<Canvas of={stories.Statuses} />

### Trigger leading icon

Use `Dropdown.LeadingIcon` inside `Dropdown.Trigger` to prefix your trigger with an icon.

<Canvas of={stories.LeadingIcon} />

## Multiple selection

When using `multiple` mode, the component manages an array of values and no longer a single value.

It means you must adapt `value`, `onValueChange` and `defaultValue` accordingly.

In `multiple` mode, the dropdown won't close when the user selects an item, and it is possible to unselect every item.

### Default

<Canvas of={stories.MultipleSelection} />

### Controlled - multiple selection

Use `value` and `onValueChange` props to control the value of the dropdown.

<Canvas of={stories.MultipleSelectionControlled} />

## Advanced usage

### Custom item

If your `Dropdown.Item` contains anything else than raw text, you may use any JSX markup to customize it.

**If you do so, you MUST use `Dropdown.ItemText` inside of your item to give it a proper accessible name.**

<Canvas of={stories.CustomItem} />

## Form field

### Label

Use `FormField.Label` to add a label to the input.

<Canvas of={stories.FormFieldLabel} />

### Hidden label

In certain cases, a visible label may not be necessary. To achieve this behavior, use the `VisuallyHidden` component.

<Canvas of={stories.FormFieldHiddenLabel} />

### Required

Use the `isRequired` prop of the `FormField` to indicate that the dropdown is required.

<Canvas of={stories.FormFieldRequired} />

### Disabled

The dropdown `disabled` field status can be managed by the FormField `disabled` flag.

<Canvas of={stories.FormFieldDisabled} />

### ReadOnly

Apply `readOnly` to the wrapping `FormField` to indicate the dropdown is only readable.

<Canvas of={stories.FormFieldReadOnly} />

### Validation

Set the `state` prop of the `FormField` to `error` to indicate that the dropdown is invalid. Optionally use the `FormField.ErrorMessage` to describe why the dropdown is invalid.

<Canvas of={stories.FormFieldValidation} />
