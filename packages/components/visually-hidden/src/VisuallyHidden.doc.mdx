# VisuallyHidden

Hides content from the screen in an accessible way.
`VisuallyHidden` hides content from visual client, but keep it readable for screen readers.
It is useful in certain scenarios as an alternative to traditional labelling with aria-label or aria-labelledby and it is the logical opposite of the aria-hidden attribute.

## Install

```
npm install @spark-ui/visually-hidden
```

## Import

```
import { VisuallyHidden } from "@spark-ui/visually-hidden"
```

## Default

A button without text can be absolutely mysterious for someone using screen reader. They might be announced simply as "button". We can solve this problem without compromising on our design. A VisuallyHidden component will allow us to place text inside this button that will only be made available to people using screen readers.

This is useful in certain scenarios as an alternative to traditional labelling with `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.
