# Accessibility

## Introduction

Accessibility is **the ability for applications to be used by everyone**, including those with disabilities such as vision, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments.

**Spark UI** addresses key aspects of accessibility, providing support for screen readers and keyboard navigation, among other valuable features. This ensures that you can seamlessly incorporate accessibility into your design process without compromising user experience.

Beyond benefiting users with disabilities, accessibility features can enhance the experience for all users. For instance, many users may find it faster and more efficient to interact with your application using a keyboard rather than a mouse or touchscreen.

## Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

Accessibility is rooted in semantics, [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2) specifications, and behavioral implementations.

To provide clear guidance, the W3C publishes the [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/), which outlines patterns and real-world examples. It also defines expected keyboard interactions and the necessary roles and states for assistive technologies. Finally the comprehensive [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21) specifications provide more detailed guidelines.

**Spark UI** components adhere to **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** guidelines and common accessibility best practices to deliver an **inclusive and user-friendly experience for all users**.

  As accessibility may easily be broken during implementation process, you should also take care of
  preserving this inclusive and user-friendly experience for all users.

## Testing

All **Spark UI** components are tested through different layers of tests (Testing library, Playwright+Axe, VoiceOver, TalkBack, ...) that are run both locally and during CI/CD.
