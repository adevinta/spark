# Setup

## Prerequisites

**Spark UI** being based on **Tailwind CSS** library, you will need to [have it installed](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) in your project.

To take benefit of a full empowered developper experience (autocomplete, syntax highlighting, linting...), you should also take a look at [**Tailwind CSS IntelliSense**](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup#intelli-sense-for-vs-code) extension. For now it comes actually only for VS Code but you also may be interested on equivalent solutions such as the ones provided [for JetBrains IDEs](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/tailwind-css.html).

## Spark setup

After completing the Tailwind CSS setup, you'll simply have to install the following packages via your command line:

```bash
npm i @spark-ui/tailwind-plugins @spark-ui/theme-utils
```

Navigate to your **Tailwind CSS configuration file** and refer to the example below for applying our Spark theme:

```css
@import 'tailwindcss';

@import './node_modules/@spark-ui/theme-utils/dist/style.css'; /* spark default theme */

@source './node_modules/@spark-ui/**/*.{js,mjs}'; /* ensure that the Spark components are scanned */
```
