    <FAQ.Question label="How do I change an element's opacity using the color opacity modifier?" />
    <FAQ.Answer>
      If you need to apply an opacity to an element color (whether it be a text color, a border color,
      a background color, etc.), you can use the following syntax:
      
      ```tsx
      <div class="bg-primary/dim-1">...</div>
      //              ^1.   ^2. ^3.
      // 1. First, add the classname that applies
      //    some color-related property to the element.
      //
      // 2. Then, use the "/" modifier.
      //
      // 3. Finally, apply the opacity by using a value from one of the opacity
      //    tokens from the theme
      ```

      By using this syntax, you can apply an opacity to any color-related property of an element.

    <FAQ.Question
      label="How do I deal with font weights?"
    />
      <FAQ.Answer>
        If you have text with the CSS class `text-body-1` applied to it but also wish to give this element a bold font weight, you can add another dedicated class to accomplish this:

        ```tsx
        <div class="text-body-1 font-bold">...</div>
        ```

        In this example, The class `text-body-1` sets the appropriate font size and line height, while `font-bold` sets the appropriate font weight.

        Tailwind Spark themes expose a set of font-weight related tokens. Be sure to check those out to see what values you have at your disposal.

    <FAQ.Question
      label="How do I handle complex CSS selectors / not-so-often-used CSS properties with Tailwind"
    />
    <FAQ.Answer>
      If you need to use complex CSS selectors or certain CSS properties with Tailwind, such as pseudo-selectors (some of which are already [natively handled by Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#first-last-odd-and-even)) or complex grids, you have two options:
      
      1/ The first option is to use the **arbitrary** API ([arbitrary properties](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#arbitrary-properties), [arbitrary variants](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#using-arbitrary-variants)), but as useful as it is for handling a few rules, it may quickly become cumbersome.
      <br/>
      2/ Alternatively, you may consider using a **traditional CSS file**, as using arbitrary values all over the place can make your code difficult to read and maintain.

    <FAQ.Question
      label="How do I handle elements that contain many Tailwind classes"
    />
    <FAQ.Answer>
      If you have an element that contains many classes (let’s say, more than a dozen), it is recommended to **group the classes by category** instead of having a **large blob of text** with all the classes, which can make the code hard to read and maintain.
      <br/>
      To achieve this, you can use a helper library like [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx) or the [cx](https://cva.style/docs/api-reference#cx) function from [cva](https://cva.style/docs), or any other library of your preference.

      This approach will make the code more organized and easier to maintain. See the example below.
      <br/>
      **before:**
      ```tsx
      <div className="flex items-center mb-sm md:mb-lg p-sm h-sz-340 w-sz-340 cursor-pointer text-underline hover:text-underline">...</div>
      ```

      **after:**
      ```tsx
      <div className={cx(
        "flex items-center",
        "h-sz-340 w-sz-340",
        "mb-sm md:mb-lg p-sm",
        "cursor-pointer text-underline hover:text-underline"
      )}>...</div>
      ```

      As to what constitutes a **category**, it depends on the use case and your personal preferences. You could use a [concentric approach](https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2011/concentric-css/), group by media queries, or whatever makes the most sense for you.

    <FAQ.Question
      label="How do I handle complex styling scenarios"
    />
    <FAQ.Answer>
      To handle complex styling scenarios, we recommend using the [CVA](https://cva.style/docs) (**Class Variance Authority**) package.

      This is what we use under the hood to style our Spark components.
      <br/>
      In a nutshell, CVA automates the process of matching classes to props, making it easier to create variants for traditional CSS.
      <br/>
      Here is an example to illustrate how it works:
      ```tsx
      import { cva, VariantProps } from 'class-variance-authority'

      const cardStyles = cva(['flex relative'], {
        variants: {
          size: {
            small: ['pt-sm'],
            medium: ['pt-md'],
            large: ['pt-lg'],
          },
          intent: {
            neutral: ['bg-neutral'],
            success: ['bg-success'],
            alert: ['bg-alert'],
          },
        },
        defaultVariants: {
          size: 'small',
          intent: 'neutral'
        },
      })

      type CardsProps = VariantProps<typeof styles>

      function Card({ size, intent, className } : CardsProps) {
        return <div className={cardStyles({ size, intent, className })}>{...}</div>
      }
      ```

      <FAQ.Answer>
        Spark UI is designed for and tested on the latest stable versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari. It does not support any version of IE, including IE 11.

        Detailed browser support is defined in our `package.json`.
