# Overview of Spark styling solution

## Introduction

Before diving into this guide, we recommend familiarizing yourself with Tailwind by exploring their comprehensive [documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first).

Once you're acquainted with it, return to this guide and continue with the rest of the content.

At its core, the Spark styling solution is a **set** of Tailwind plugins that customize the default Tailwind theme to suit our requirements.

## Tokens

It is important to note that although Spark is using TailwindCSS class prefixed, most of the class suffixes does not follow the same naming/semantics.

<div className="flex gap-lg">
  <div className=" bg-error-container text-on-error-container rounded-md flex-1 p-lg">
    <h3>❌ With Tailwind (arbitrary values)</h3>
    Tailwind's default theme tends to favor numerical scales to manage its tokens.

    For instance, **margins** are declared as follows:
    - `m-1` // 4px
    - `m-1.5` // 6px
    - `m-2` // 8px
    - and so on

    A similar approach is used for **colors**:

    - `bg-blue-100`
    - `bg-blue-200`
    - and so on

  </div>

  <div className="bg-success-container text-on-success-container rounded-md flex-1 p-lg">
    <h3>✅ With Spark (semantic values)</h3>
    In contrast, our Spark design system adopts a semantic approach. For **margins**, we use:

    - `m-sm` // 4px
    - `m-md` // 8px
    - `m-lg` // 16px
    - and so on

    For colors, we use:

    - `bg-main`
    - `bg-support`
    - `bg-success`
    - and so on

  </div>
</div>

## Anatomy of a Tailwind token-related class:

If we step back and take a closer look at how a typical Tailwind token-related class is made up, it can be broken down into two parts:

The first part, is the **prefix** (appearing before the `*` in the examples below):

- `m-*` for margin, `mb-*` for margin-bottom, `p-*` for padding, `pl-*` for padding-left, etc.
- `text-*` for text colors
- `bg-*` for background colors
- …

The second part is the **value** (appearing after the `-` in the examples below)

with the **Tailwind default** theme:

- `m-1` for a small margin, `p-10` for a large padding
- `text-blue-100` for a blue text color
- `bg-green-200` for a green background color
- ...

with the **Spark** styling solution:

- `m-sm` for a small margin, `p-lg` for a large padding
- `text-support` for a support text color
- `bg-success` for a success background color
- …

In summary, our Tailwind plugins primarily remap the **values** of the default Tailwind theme, while maintaining the **same prefixes**.

This ensures a seamless experience for those familiar with Tailwind, as the naming convention API remains unchanged, with only the values differing.

## Spark specific values/class names:

Keep in mind that only the **token-related values are remapped**.

We don't alter the rest of the classes exposed by Tailwind, such as the `flex`-related ones, the `grid`-related ones, the `display`-related ones, among others.

In essence, **every class not related to tokens is kept untouched**.

So, if you don't find the class you're seeking within our [dedicated page](https://sparkui.vercel.app/viewer/), the answer is probably on the [Tailwind website](https://tailwindcss.com).
