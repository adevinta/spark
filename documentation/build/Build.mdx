## How it works

Vite manages the build task of each package. Among other things, Vite offers "a build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production."

When it is time to deploy your app for production, simply run the `vite build` command.

## Configuration

Each package must include a `vite.config.ts` that will allow custom configurations about the final result of the artifact. You can find the list of possible settings on the [Vite documentation website](https://vitejs.dev/config/build-options.html#build-target).

Spark has a base configuration located in the `/config` directory with some default settings shared between all the packages. Including:

### build.target

Definition: Browser compatibility target for the final bundle.

[Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/config/build-options.html#build-target)

```json
build.target: 'es2015'
```

### build.lib

```json
build.lib: {
  entry: 'src/index.ts',
      formats: ['es', 'cjs'],
      fileName: 'index',
}
```

Definition: Build as a library.

- `entry` is required since the library cannot use HTML as entry.
- `name` is the exposed global variable and is required when formats includes 'umd' or 'iife'.
- `formats`: Default formats are ['es', 'umd'], or ['es', 'cjs'], if multiple entries are used.
- `fileName` is the name of the package file output, default fileName is the name option of package.json. It can also be defined as a function taking the format and entryAlias as arguments.
