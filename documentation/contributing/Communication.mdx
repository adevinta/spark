## [Communication](https://zeroheight.com/2c2e9ba82/p/77af7e-comunication)

We value every effort to bring designers and developers closer together. The language you use should always be correct but not at the expense of providing clarity.

- Use vocabulary with clear meaning for both designers and engineers
- Choose words that provide mutual understanding over specificity
- Communicate what you are trying to achieve, and also what you are not trying to achieve as well
- Give examples and descriptions for new words
- Force yourself to be consistent with the vocabulary when writing and talking
