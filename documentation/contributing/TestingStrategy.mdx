<StoryHeading label="Scripts" />

**`npm run test`**: run tests in watch mode (in your terminal)

**`npm run test:ui`**: Run tests in watch mode (in your browser)

**`npm run test:run`**: Run tests once

**`npm run test:coverage`**: Run tests coverage. Output is visible in the terminal, or the `coverage` folder that is generated (html reporter).

<StoryHeading label="Vitest" />

[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/guide/why.html) is the test runner used by Spark.

It allows everything a test runner is known for: test suites, mocking, coverage, test filtering, etc.

We highly recommand you install [the official plugin](https://vitest.dev/guide/ide.html) that matches your IDE (it supports VSCode and IntelliJ).

<StoryHeading label="Testing Library" />

[Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/) is our main ...testing library :3

Before writing tests for any type of Spark package (component, utility, etc), **you must get familiar with the philosophy behing the library**:

**[https://testing-library.com/docs/]()**

Mainly, the idea is to focus on a user-centric approach, especially for component packages. We must test interfaces the same way a user would interact with them.
What's important to test is the interface we provide to users, not their technical implementations.

> The more your tests resemble the way your software is used,
> the more confidence they can give you.

<StoryHeading label="user-event" />

[user-event](https://testing-library.com/docs/ecosystem-user-event/) is a companion library that is part
of the Testing Library ecosystem.

It provides a cleaner way to simulates user events, closer to the real browser behaviour. **It replaces the `fireEvent` method from Testing Library, WHICH MUST NOT BE USED.**

You can read here in details why it is better than `fireEvent`: [https://testing-library.com/docs/user-event/intro#differences-from-fireevent]()

<StoryHeading label="Testing components" />

Spark component packages are scaffolded with a default test file using `Vitest` + `Testing Library` + `user-event`.

<StoryHeading label="Grouping tests" as="h3" />

Group tests in logical blocks using the `describe()` method from `vitest`.

```tsx
import { describe } from 'vitest'

describe('MenuBar behaviour', () => { ... }) // first block
describe('BurgerMenu behaviour', () => { ... }) // second block
```

<StoryHeading label="Naming your tests" as="h3" />

Each test description must start with `should`

```tsx
import { describe, it } from 'vitest'

describe('MenuBar behaviour', () => {
   it('should open subMenu on hover', ( ) => { ... }) // first test in this block
   it('should display login button when user is not logged', ( ) => { ... }) // second test in this block
   it('should display spinner when user click on login button', ( ) => { ... }) // third test in this block
})
```

<StoryHeading label="Given/When/Then and test assertions" as="h3" />

Inside a test, we recommand you stick with the [Given/When/Then pattern](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/GivenWhenThen.html).
Followind this same pattern across tests makes them easier to read and understand.

```tsx
import { expect, it } from 'vitest'

it('should trigger click event', async () => {
  const user = userEvent.setup()
  const clickEvent = vi.fn()

  // Given a button with a "bar" label
  render(<Button onClick={clickEvent}>bar</Button>)

  // When I click on the button with that label
  await user.click(screen.getByText('bar'))

  // Then the onClick event must have been triggered once
  expect(clickEvent).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
})
```

<StoryHeading label="Triggering user events" as="h3" />

[User events](https://testing-library.com/docs/user-event/intro#writing-tests-with-userevent) are simulated using `user-event`, as seen on the previous example.

```tsx
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'
```

Then triggering events from that object:

```tsx
await user.click(screen.getByText('bar'))
```

A few things to note:

- It is recommanded that you setup the `user` indepently in each test, doing `const user = userEvent.setup()`. That way, you can pass different options at test-level if necessary.
- Calls to events (`user.click, user.keyboard, user.scroll`, etc.) are asynchronous, so you MUST use `async/await` on your tests when using it.

<StoryHeading label="Testing utilities" />

Hooks, methods, and other type of utilities that are not user interfaces are simply tested using unit testing.
So for most of them you won't require Testing Library.

For hooks we use the `renderHook` method from [@testing-library/react-hooks](https://github.com/testing-library/react-hooks-testing-library).
