# Testing strategy

- [Scripts](#scripts)
- [Vitest](#vitest)
- [Testing library](#testing-library)
- [Testing library: user-event](#userevent)
- [Testing components](#testing-components)
  - [Grouping tests](#grouping-tests)
  - [Naming your tests](#naming-your-tests)
  - [Given/When/Then and test assertions](#givenwhenthen-and-test-assertions)
  - [Triggering user events](#triggering-user-events)
- [Testing utilities (methods, hooks)](#testing-utilities)

## Scripts

**`npm run test`**: run tests in watch mode (in your terminal)

**`npm run test:ui`**: run tests in watch mode (in your browser)

**`npm run test:run`**: run tests once

**`npm run test:coverage`**: run tests with coverage. Output is visible in the terminal, or in the `coverage` folder that is generated (html reporter).

## Vitest

[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/guide/why.html) is the test runner used by Spark.

It allows everything a test runner is known for: test suites, mocking, coverage, test filtering, etc.

We highly recommend installing [the official plugin](https://vitest.dev/guide/ide.html) that matches your IDE (it supports VSCode and IntelliJ).

## Testing Library

[Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/) is our main... testing library :3

Before writing tests for any Spark package (component, utility, etc.), **you must get familiar with the philosophy behind the library**. Go through [the documentation](https://testing-library.com/docs/).

Mainly, the idea is to focus on a user-centric approach, especially for component packages. We must test interfaces the same way a user would interact with them.
We want to check the interface we provide to users, not their technical implementations.

> The more your tests resemble the way your software is used,
> the more confidence they can give you.

## user-event

[user-event](https://testing-library.com/docs/ecosystem-user-event/) is a companion library that is part
of the Testing Library ecosystem.

It provides a cleaner way to simulate user events. It is closer to the browser behavior. **It replaces the `fireEvent` method from Testing Library, WHICH MUST NOT BE USED.**

You can read [here](https://testing-library.com/docs/user-event/intro#differences-from-fireevent) in detail why it is better than `fireEvent`.

## Testing components

Spark component packages are scaffolded with a default test file using `Vitest` + `Testing Library` + `user-event`.

### Grouping tests

Group tests in logical blocks using the `describe()` method from `vitest`.

```tsx
import { describe } from 'vitest'

describe('MenuBar behaviour', () => { ... }) // first block
describe('BurgerMenu behaviour', () => { ... }) // second block
```

### Naming your tests

Each test description must start with `should`

```tsx
import { describe, it } from 'vitest'

describe('MenuBar behaviour', () => {
   it('should open subMenu on hover', ( ) => { ... }) // first test in this block
   it('should display login button when user is not logged', ( ) => { ... }) // second test in this block
   it('should display spinner when user click on login button', ( ) => { ... }) // third test in this block
})
```

### Given/When/Then and test assertions

Inside a test, we recommend you stick with the [Given/When/Then pattern](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/GivenWhenThen.html).
Following this same pattern across tests makes them easier to read and understand.

```tsx
import { expect, it } from 'vitest'

it('should trigger click event', async () => {
  const user = userEvent.setup()
  const clickEvent = vi.fn()

  // Given a button with a "bar" label
  render(<Button onClick={clickEvent}>bar</Button>)

  // When I click on the button with that label
  await user.click(screen.getByText('bar'))

  // Then the onClick event must have been triggered once
  expect(clickEvent).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
})
```

### Triggering user events

[User events](https://testing-library.com/docs/user-event/intro#writing-tests-with-userevent) are simulated using `user-event`, as seen in the previous example.

```tsx
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'
```

Then you can trigger events from that object:

```tsx
await user.click(screen.getByText('bar'))
```

A few things to note:

- It is recommended that you set up the `user` independently in each test, doing `const user = userEvent.setup()`. That way, you can pass different options at the test level if necessary.
- Calls to events (`user.click, user.keyboard, user.scroll`, etc.) are asynchronous, so you MUST use `async/await` on your tests.

## Testing utilities

Hooks, methods, and other types of utilities that are not user interfaces are simply tested using unit testing.
So for most of them, you won't require Testing Library.

For hooks we use the `renderHook` method from [@testing-library/react-hooks](https://github.com/testing-library/react-hooks-testing-library).
