# Component - Definition of Done

<Callout kind="warning">
  Work in progress. This page must be submitted to the Spark team to get the approval.
</Callout>

**This document provides a list of criterias that each Spark component must fulfill.**

## 1. Must provide stateful implementation

A stateful component is a component that holds some state.
Stateful implementation, also called "uncontrolled" mode, means that every component that has visual interactions (ex: Radio, Checkbox, Popover, etc.) must be able to trigger those status changes without any props.

For example, a simple `Checkbox` should be able to be checked/unchecked without being controlled by a prop:

```jsx
<Checkbox /> // stateful implementation
```

As opposed to a controlled (stateless) implementation, which would be controlled from the outside by a prop:

```jsx
<Checkbox isChecked={isMyCheckboxChecked} /> // stateless implementation
```

Stateful implementation makes integration easier for developers for basic use-cases, because they don't need to necessarily know the props of the component.

## 2. Must provide stateless implementation (controlled mode)

For other edge-cases, or simply to enforce better control over components, **both stateful and stateless implementation must be implemented in a Spark component**.

Most of the time, it implies props for the value of the various states, as well as props for event handlers, to detect when/how to update a state.

Controlled mode is nice for edge-cases, for example, if you want to add conditions to state updates:

```jsx
const [isChecked, setIsChecked] = useState(false)

// stateless controlled implementation
<Checkbox
    isChecked={isChecked}
    onCheckedChange={(value: boolean): void => {
        if (user.isLoggedIn()) {
            setIsChecked(value)
        } else {
            alert('You must be logged in to use that feature.')
        }
    }}
/>
```

<Callout kind="info">
  <p>**To summarize:**</p>
  <ul class="p-md">
    <li>- Stateful (uncontrolled) mode relies on the component's internal state.</li>
    <li>- Stateless (controlled) mode relies on an external state provided through props.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>**Both must be possible for every Spark component.**</p>
</Callout>

## 3. Must forward ref to component

`forwardRef` is a feature in React that allows you to pass a `ref` from a parent component to a child component. This is useful when you want to access the underlying DOM element or React component instance of a child component from a parent component.

Here are some common scenarios where you might want to use `forwardRef`:

1. Accessing child component DOM elements: If you need to manipulate or retrieve information from a DOM element in a child component, you can use `forwardRef` to pass a `ref` to the child component and then use that `ref` to access the underlying DOM element.
2. Controlling child component behavior: If you need to control the behavior of a child component from a parent component, you can use `forwardRef` to pass a `ref` to the child component and then use that `ref` to call methods on the child component instance.
3. Integrating with third-party libraries: If you're using a third-party library that expects a `ref` to be passed to a component, you can use `forwardRef` to pass a `ref` to the child component and then pass that `ref` to the third-party library.

Here's an example of how you might use `forwardRef` to pass a `ref` to a child component:

```jsx
import React, { forwardRef } from 'react'

const ChildComponent = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  return <div ref={ref}>Child component</div>
})

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const childRef = React.createRef()

  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log(childRef.current) // logs the child component DOM element
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <ChildComponent ref={childRef} />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Log child ref</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

In this example, `ChildComponent` is a child component that uses `forwardRef` to pass a `ref` to its underlying DOM element. ParentComponent renders ChildComponent and also creates a `ref` using `React.createRef()`. When the button is clicked, the `handleClick` function logs the `childRef.current` value, which is the underlying DOM element of `ChildComponent`.

Overall, `forwardRef` is a powerful feature in React that can help you access and control child components from parent components, integrate with third-party libraries, and more.

## 4. Must be composable (compound components only)

Spark components are of two kinds:

- **Single components**: Consist of only one element and are generally simpler and easier to use. They are typically used when a particular functionality is required in a single instance and does not need to interact with other components. Single part components are often more lightweight and can be easier to maintain and test.
- **Compound components**: Consist of multiple elements and are designed to work together to provide more complex functionality. They are often used when a more sophisticated solution is required, or when multiple components need to be combined to achieve a particular outcome. Compound components are often more modular and can be reused across different parts of an application.

<Callout kind="info">
  **If your component's visual part could be used separately to achieve different layouts, you must
  use the compound component pattern**
</Callout>

Composability refers to the ability to combine smaller building blocks to create larger and more complex structures. In React, composability is important because it enables developers to create reusable, modular components that can be easily combined to create complex user interfaces.

There are several benefits to composing React components:

- **Reusability**: Composable components can be reused in multiple parts of an application or in multiple applications altogether, reducing development time and increasing code maintainability.
- **Scalability**: As an application grows, composability allows developers to add new components without having to refactor existing code.
- **Flexibility**: Composable components can be easily rearranged and combined to create new UIs, giving developers more flexibility in designing the application.
- **Readability**: Composable components are typically smaller and easier to understand than large, monolithic components. This makes it easier for developers to read, understand, and modify the codebase.
- **Testability**: Composable components can be tested in isolation, which makes it easier to write and maintain automated tests.

Overall, composability is an important aspect of building scalable, maintainable, and flexible React applications. By breaking down complex user interfaces into smaller, composable components, developers can create code that is easier to understand, modify, and test.

**Other benefits involves:**

- Markup (JSX) is interopable with custom html elements.
- Drastically reduce the number of props. No more monolithic components.

<p className="sb-unstyled font-bold text-error">
  You must absolutely avoid the monolithic approach when writing a compound component.
</p>

❌ Monolithic:

```jsx
import { Dialog } from '@spark-ui/components/dialog'

function MyDialog() {
  return (
    <>
      <button type="button">Open dialog</button>
      <Dialog
        title="My dialog"
        size="medium"
        isOpen={isModalOpened}
        withOverlay={false}
        withCloseButton={false}
      >
        My modal content.
      </Dialog>
    </>
  )
}
```

✅ Composable:

```jsx
import { Dialog } from '@spark-ui/components/dialog'

function MyDialog() {
  return (
    <Dialog size="medium">
      <Dialog.Trigger>
        <button type="button">Open dialog</button>
      </Dialog.Trigger>
      <Dialog.Portal>
        {/* <Dialog.Overlay /> */}
        <Dialog.Content>
          <Dialog.Title>My dialog</Dialog.Title>
          {/* <Dialog.CloseButton /> */}
          <p>My modal content.</p>
        </Dialog.Content>
      </Dialog.Portal>
    </Dialog>
  )
}
```

## 5. Chrome extension compatibility

Spark provides a Chrome extension that can highlight any Spark component on any website using Spark.
This feature requires every Spark component to have a `data-spark-component` HTML attribute.

This attribute's value must be the component name (kebab-case). **For compound components, each subComponent must have the attribute.**

```
<div data-spark-component="radio-group" ...
```

## 6. Enable outside customization with className

Every spark component must accept a className so that consumers can customize its styling for their use-cases, for example:

- adding some margin
- adding some absolute positioning
- adding some responsive behaviour

```jsx
<Button className="absolute top-0 m-md md:top-lg">My custom button</Button>
```

Be careful if you are spreading props inside Spark components, you must get the `className` and apply it to the JSX.
Otherwise, passing a `className` to the component would erase its default styles.

### ❌ Don't spread `className` attribute

```jsx
export const MySparkComponent = ({ children, ...rest }) => {
  return (
    <div
      data-spark-component="demo-component"
      className="p-md bg-primary text-on-primary"
      {...rest} // ❌ If the consumer pass a `className` prop, it would override the className just above.
    >
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### ✅ Combine className prop with inner styles

```jsx
export const MySparkComponent = ({
  children,
  className, // ✅ get the className from props...
  ...rest
}) => {
  return (
    <div
      data-spark-component="demo-component"
      className={`p-md bg-primary text-on-primary ${className}`} // ✅ ...and merge it with existing classes.
      {...rest}
    >
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### ✅ Combine className prop with CVA styles

```jsx
export const MySparkComponent = ({
  children,
  className, // ✅ get the className from props...
  ...rest
}) => {
  return (
    // ✅ ...and pass it to the CVA method returning your styles
    <div data-spark-component="demo-component" className={styles({ className })} {...rest}>
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}
```
