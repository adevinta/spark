# Package structure

Every single published package will be included inside `packages` directory.

- If a package is a **React Component**, it will be placed inside `packages/components`
- If a package is a **React Hook**, it will be placed inside `packages/hooks`
- If a package is a **utility**, it will be placed inside `packages/utils`

Every single published package will follow that structure:

**For a React Component called `@spark-ui/dummy`**

- `package.json`<sup>\*</sup>: json manifest of the package.
- `README.md`<sup>\*</sup>: markdown file explaining the basics of the package
- `LICENSE`<sup>\*</sup>: explains how users can use, change, and distribute the package.
- `CHANGELOG.md`<sup>\*</sup>: markdown that includes all the changes made over time.
- `.gitignore`<sup>\*</sup>: includes the untracked git rules in the package.
- `.npmignore`<sup>\*</sup>: includes the untracked npm rules of the package
- `tsconfig.json`<sup>\*</sup>: includes the specific ts configs of a package
- `vite.config.ts`<sup>\*</sup>: include teh specific vite configs of a package.
- `dist/`: directory created with the bundle of a package. It will be ignored by `.gitignore`.
- `src/<sup>*</sup>`: directory containing the source code of the package.
- `index.tsx`<sup>\*</sup> a file that only contains import-export all its inner-exposed resources

**If there is a React component `Dummy` entity it will have:**

- `[Dummy].tsx` (1 file per component, = named as is)
- `[Dummy].test.js`: contains the unit tests of that entity
- `[Dummy].stories.mdx` contains the basic stories of that entity
- `[Dummy].stories.tsx` contains variants and complex stories of that entity
- `[Dummy].variants.tsx`: contains the setup of the different default and variation styles related to that entity.

**If the component also includes many other entities (ex: `Element`) they follow the same structure as the Dummy entity:**

- `[DummyElement].tsx`
- `[DummyElement].test.js`
- `[DummyElement].stories.mdx`
- `[DummyElement].stories.tsx`
- `[DummyElement].variants.tsx`
