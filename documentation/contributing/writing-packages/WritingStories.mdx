# Writing stories

The following guide is showing you how to structure your components documentation.

## Docs VS Stories

Each component must have a `doc` and a `stories` file. For example:

- `MyComponent.doc.mdx`: Main page of documentation for the component. It uses markdown (MDX) syntax for easy documentation.
  - This page gather the component's props and stories
- `MyComponent.stories.tsx`:
  - This file contains every example (story) for your component.
  - It is using the CSF format.

**Only the `docs` file will be visible in the sidebar**

## Docs page

- Every Docs file must have the following extension: `*.doc.mdx` (ex: `Input.doc.mdx`).
- **You must write the following sections in the same order for every component.**

### 1. Title

Every page must have an `h1` heading, followed by the description of the component.

```
# Input

Component used to get user input in a text field, etc.
```

### 2. Meta

The meta is the semantic information about the documented component. Storybook needs it to properly link the `docs` page to its stories.

The meta itself must be declared in the `*stories.tsx` file, but must be referenced in this one to link both files.

```
import { Meta } from '@storybook/blocks'

import * as stories from './Input.stories'

<Meta of={stories} />
```

### 3. Install

Add a section to show developers how to install this component on their repository.

````
## Install

Install the component from your command line.

```sh
npm install @spark-ui/input
```
````

### 4. Import

Add a section to show developers how to import this component from their repository.

````
## Import

Import all parts and piece them together.

```tsx
import { Input, InputGroup } from '@spark-ui/input'
```
````

### 5. Props table

We provide a custom `ArgTypes` component to display the component's props. This component also works for compound components, as opposed to Storybook native one.

**For compound components, you can use `subcomponent` key to also showcase props for each.**

```
import { ArgTypes } from '@docs/helpers/ArgTypes'

<ArgTypes
  of={Input}
  description="Input component is a component that is used to get user input in a text field."
  subcomponents={{
    InputGroup: {
      of: InputGroup,
      description:
        'Use this wrapper whenever you need a more complex text input. For example if you need to have leading/trailing icons or addons.',
    },
    'InputGroup.LeadingAddon': {
      of: InputGroup.LeadingAddon,
      description:
        'Add any type of component that will be displayed before the input field.\n This provides flexibility to include additional elements, such as buttons or dropdowns, to enhance the user interface and provide clear context or guidance to the user.',
    },
    etc...
  }}
/>
```

### 5. Usage

From here you will showcase examples of how to use your component in a "feature by feature" way.

- **Each story should come with an explicit description preceding the interactive canvas**
- **Each story displayed under this section should be in a very specific order (for consistency)**
  - "Default" (a minimal story showcasing how to use your component for the most common case)
  - "Uncontrolled" (stateful example where you don't use props but rely on internal state)
  - "Controlled" (stateless example where you use props instead of internal state)
  - **Every other example should be sorted in alphabetical order**

<Callout kind="warning">
  Each story should showcase a single prop/feature of your component. **Avoid stories mixing many
  properties at once to keep things simple**.
</Callout>

Example `input` "Usage" section:

```

import { Canvas, Story } from '@storybook/blocks'

## Usage

### Default

<Canvas of={stories.Default} />

### Uncontrolled

Use `defaultValue` prop to set the default value of the input. Optionally `onChange` prop can be used to know when the value of the input changes.

<Canvas of={stories.Uncontrolled} />

### Controlled

Use `value` and `onChange` props to control the value of the input.

<Canvas of={stories.Controlled} />

### Addons

Each `InputGroup` can have a `LeadingAddon` and a `TrailingAddon`. You can use them to achieve more complex custom inputs. Addons can be decorative or interactive.

**Note: we advise to use `solid` addons when possible to give the user a better clickable area**

<Canvas of={stories.Addons} />

### Disabled

To indicate that an input is disabled, use the `disabled` prop. If you're wrapping your `Input` with an `InputGroup`, set the prop on the group instead.

<Canvas of={stories.Disabled} />

### etc. (be careful about alphabetical order)
```

### 6. Advanced Usage

Same as previous section, but this is where you should move more advanced examples:

- Combination with other Spark components
- Highly customized styles to showcase alternate use
- Obscure features that are reserved for edge-cases or should not be encouraged

The goal of this section is to keep "Usage" clean and focused on most generic usage of the component.

```
## Advanced usage

### Search

Let's use `InputGroup` and its components to create a search input with a clear button

<Canvas of={stories.SearchExample} />

### Password

Let's use `InputGroup` and its components to create a password input with a show/hide password functionality

<Canvas of={stories.PasswordExample} />
```

### 7. Accessibility

It is nice to add an `Accessibility` section at the end to summarize keyboard interactions and important a11y requirements of the component.

```

## Accessibility

Adheres to the Radio Group WAI-ARIA design pattern and uses roving tabindex to manage focus movement among radio items.

### Keyboard Interactions

- `Tab`: Moves focus to either the checked radio item or the first radio item in the group.
- `Space`: When focus is on an unchecked radio item, checks it.
- `ArrowDown`: Moves focus and checks the next radio item in the group.
- `ArrowRight`: Moves focus and checks the next radio item in the group.
- `ArrowUp`: Moves focus to the previous radio item in the group.
- `ArrowLeft`: Moves focus to the previous radio item in the group.

```

## Stories

### Guidelines

- Every stories file must have the following extension: `*.stories.tsx`.
- You should write one story per prop. Avoid compolicated stories mixing many props.

### 1. Define the Meta

Component must be using a `Components/*` meta. This meta must be the default export of the file.

Please refer to [official Storybook documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/7.0/react/writing-stories/introduction#default-export) to see extra arguments you may be able to use.

```tsx
// Radio.stories.tsx

import { Meta, StoryFn, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react'
import { useState } from 'react'

import { Radio, RadioGroup } from '.'

const meta: Meta<typeof RadioGroup> = {
  title: 'Components/RadioGroup',
  component: RadioGroup,
}

export default meta
```

### 2. Write down your stories

Please refer to [official Storybook documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/7.0/react/writing-stories/introduction#defining-stories) to see how you can write stories

<Callout kind="warning">
  Avoid using `_args` if you story has some JS logic (`useState`, etc). When using `_args`, only JSX
  will be visible when interacting the `show source` button of the Canvas.
</Callout>

```tsx
// Radio.stories.tsx

export const Default: StoryFn = _args => (
  <RadioGroup className="flex gap-md">
    <Radio value="1" />
    <Radio value="2" />
    <Radio value="3" />
  </RadioGroup>
)

export const Controlled: StoryFn = _args => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('1')

  const handleChange = (current: string) => {
    setValue(current)
  }

  return (
    <RadioGroup className="flex gap-md" value={value} onValueChange={handleChange}>
      <Radio value="1" />
      <Radio value="2" />
      <Radio value="3" />
    </RadioGroup>
  )
}

// ...additional stories
```
