## [Implementation](https://zeroheight.com/2c2e9ba82/p/85d5e7-implementation)

- Develop just enough of a solution
- Value declarative over abstraction
- A little verbosity is better than clever code. Avoid implementations that reduce the ability of people to contribute
- Decrease repetition with abstraction and automation
- Provide flexibility, but within the boundaries of our agreements
- Assume that people will break the rules, and provide safe ways for them to do so.
