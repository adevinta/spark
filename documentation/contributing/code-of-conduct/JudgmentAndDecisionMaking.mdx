## [Judgment and Decision-making](https://zeroheight.com/2c2e9ba82/p/177da9-judgment-and-decision-making)

- If you are at risk of getting stuck due to the ambiguity or difference of opinions, make decisions that will help us moving forward
- Make short-term decisions based on long-term goals
- Evaluate tools and integrations by the risk they present, not just the solution they offer. If the risk is high pay special attention.
- Prioritize solutions for people who use Spark and how it serves the customers who use products built with Spark
- Seek feedback on code review often, and more often when a solution takes you down a new path
- Take time to provide good code review, encompassing the above values when providing feedback.
