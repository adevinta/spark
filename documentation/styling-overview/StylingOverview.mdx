# Overview of Spark styling solution

## Introduction

Before diving into this guide, we recommend familiarizing yourself with Tailwind by exploring their comprehensive [documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first).

Once you're acquainted with it, return to this guide and continue with the rest of the content.

At its core, the Spark styling solution is a **set** of Tailwind plugins that customize the default Tailwind theme to suit our requirements.

<Callout>See documention for our plugins [here](?path=/docs/utils-tailwind-plugins--docs)</Callout>

## Tokens

Tailwind's default theme tends to favor numerical scales to manage its tokens.

For instance, **margins** are declared as follows:

- `m-1` // 4px
- `m-1.5` // 6px
- `m-2` // 8px
- and so on

A similar approach is used for **colors**:

- `bg-blue-100`
- `bg-blue-200`
- and so on

In contrast, our Spark design system adopts a semantic approach. For **margins**, we use:

- `m-sm` // 4px
- `m-md` // 8px
- `m-lg` // 16px
- and so on

For colors, we use:

- `bg-primary`
- `bg-secondary`
- `bg-success`
- and so on

## Anatomy of a Tailwind token-related class:

If we step back and take a closer look at how a typical Tailwind token-related class is made up, it can be broken down into two parts:

The first part, is the **prefix** (appearing before the `*` in the examples below):

- `m-*` for margin, `m-b-*` for margin-bottom, `p-*` for padding, `p-l-*` for padding-left, etc.
- `text-*` for text colors
- `bg-*` for background colors
- …

The second part is the **value** (appearing after the `-` in the examples below)

with the **Tailwind default** theme:

- `m-1` for a small margin, `p-10` for a large padding
- `text-blue-100` for a blue text color
- `bg-green-200` for a green background color
- ...

with the **Spark** styling solution:

- `m-sm` for a small margin, `p-lg` for a large padding
- `text-secondary` for a secondary text color
- `bg-success` for a success background color
- …

In summary, our Tailwind plugins primarily remap the **values** of the default Tailwind theme, while maintaining the **same prefixes**.

This ensures a seamless experience for those familiar with Tailwind, as the naming convention API remains unchanged, with only the values differing.

## Spark specific values/class names:

Keep in mind that only the **token-related values are remapped**.

We don't alter the rest of the classes exposed by Tailwind, such as the `flex`-related ones, the `grid`-related ones, the `display`-related ones, among others.

In essence, **every class not related to tokens is kept untouched**.

So, if you don't find the class you're seeking within our [dedicated page](https://sparkui.vercel.app/viewer/), the answer is probably on the [Tailwind website](https://tailwindcss.com).
