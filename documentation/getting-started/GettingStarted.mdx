  **The Spark Design System** is built using the **Tailwind CSS** framework.

If you haven't installed **TailwindCSS** yet, you can follow the [TailwindCSS installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

<StoryHeading label="Installation" as="h2" />

After setting up Tailwind for your application, install the following packages via your command line:

```bash
npm i @spark-ui/tailwind-plugins @spark-ui/theme-utils
```

Next, navigate to your **Tailwind config file**. Refer to the example below for proper configuration of our Spark plugins:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
const sparkPlugins = require('@spark-ui/tailwind-plugins')
const themeUtils = require('@spark-ui/theme-utils')

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: ['./node_modules/@spark-ui/**/*.{js,mjs}'], // ⬅️ ensure that the Spark components are scanned
  plugins: [
    ...sparkPlugins.sparkConfig({
      htmlFontSize: 16, // replace this value with your app's base font size if needed (default: 16)
      themes: {
        default: themeUtils.defaultTheme,
        dark: themeUtils.defaultThemeDark,
      },
    }),
  ],
}
```

Two important notes regarding the example above:

- we are using our default themes from our `theme-utils` package. However, you can replace it with your own themes, as long as they adhere to our `Theme` interface.
  The Theme interface is available through the [**@spark-ui/theme-utils**](?path=/docs/utils-theme--docs) package.

- The `sparkConfig` plugin accepts an object with two fields: `themes` and `htmlFontSize`.

**themes**:

An object containing your themes. Each key in the object will be extracted to a `[data-theme]` attribute, and the values will be converted to CSS custom properties inside the `css` file generated by Tailwing. **Note that this object requires a key with a value of default**, which specifies the default theme for your project.

For example, if your `themes` object looks like this:

```js

sparkPlugins.sparkConfig({
  themes: {
    default: yourDefaultTheme,
    alternative: someAlternativeTheme,
  },
}),
```

Tailwind will generate the following CSS:

```css
:root {
  /* ...tokens from yourDefaultTheme */
}

[data-theme='alternative'] {
  /* ...tokens from someAlternativeTheme */
}
```

**htmlFontSize (optional)**:

Spark uses a base font size of **16 pixels** as a standard value for calculating the sizes of all other font-related properties defined in the theme. For example, our `spacing.lg` value is defined as **1rem**, which is equal to 16 pixels (based on the default base font size of 16 pixels).

However, if your application uses a different base font size, such as **10 pixels** for example, this can cause issues with the sizing of elements in the application. To account for this, you can set the `htmlFontSize` to the appropriate value for your application's base font size. This will adjust the `rem` based values in Spark to be relative to the new base font size.

<StoryHeading label="Extending Spark config" as="h2" />

In cases where you need to tackle uncommon situations, it's important to note that our theme configuration can be extended or overridden using the standard Tailwind approach, as illustrated in the example below:

```js
// tailwind.config.js

module.exports = {
  content: [...],
  plugins: [...],
   theme: {
    extend: {
      screens: {
        customScreen: '218px', // ⬅️ extending our Spark theme configuration
        ...
      }
    }
  },
}
```

That's all there is to it! 🎉
